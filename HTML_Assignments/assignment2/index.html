    <p>I love travelling to different palcces in India, whether it's a city full of history and monuments, or <br>filled with natural beauty like mountains and forests. Or might contain ancient temples or some Gorgeous beaches. <br> I love exploring all of such places to experience different culture, foods, clothings, and all of their diversity. <br>
    Here are some of the places that I have visited recently:</p>
