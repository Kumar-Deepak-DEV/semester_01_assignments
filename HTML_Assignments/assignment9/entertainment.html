        <h3>'Baaghi 4' Leaks Online Hours After Release—Industry Alarmed</h3>
        <p>Tiger Shroff's highly anticipated action flick Baaghi 4 hit theaters on September 5, 2025, amid considerable fanfare—but excitement turned sour when the film was illegally leaked online within hours of release. The leak across torrent sites and streaming platforms could severely dampen box-office returns for the film, which earned around ₹11 crore on opening day despite stiff competition from The Bengal Files and The Conjuring: Last Rites. Directed by A. Harsha and featuring a high-octane cast including Sanjay Dutt, Sonam Bajwa, and Harnaaz Sandhu, the franchise's latest installment faces a major setback. The incident has reignited concerns over digital piracy's growing threat to the film industry, as producers and distributors grapple with protecting intellectual property and revenue streams.</p>
