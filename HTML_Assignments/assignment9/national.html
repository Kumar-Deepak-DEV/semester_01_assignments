        <h3> Ghaggar Floods Ravage Haryana and Punjab, Thousands Affected</h3>

<p>Heavy rains and breaches in the Ghaggar river have triggered devastating floods across Haryana and Punjab, submerging over 180 villages and destroying nearly 90,000 acres of standing crops. Districts like Fatehabad, Sirsa, and Hisar are the worst hit, with road networks, schools, and irrigation systems severely damaged. Relief efforts are underway, but many families remain stranded as water levels continue to rise. Authorities have urged residents to stay indoors while compensation portals have been opened for farmers, with a deadline of September 10 to file claims. The disaster poses both humanitarian and agricultural challenges for the state governments.</p>

        <h3>GST Reduction on Renewable Energy Products to Boost Clean Power</h3>

<p>In a major reform to accelerate India's energy transition, the government has reduced the Goods and Services Tax (GST) on renewable energy equipment—from 12% to 5%—effective September 22, 2025. The move is expected to lower solar generation costs by 10 paise per unit and wind power by up to 17 paise per unit, making clean energy more affordable for utilities and consumers. By shifting tax burdens onto fossil fuels, the government hopes to promote faster adoption of green energy. Experts say this step will attract more investment into India’s renewable sector and push the country closer to its net-zero goals.</p>
